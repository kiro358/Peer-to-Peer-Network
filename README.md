# Peer-to-Peer-Network
COE 768 Final Project

The computer network’s final project is based on the development of a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) network using socket programming in C. The project’s primary objective was to establish a decentralized network where peers can register themselves as users, and upload/register content such as files, movies, videos, etc. Additionally, users must be able to perform content-related operations such as searching, downloading, and deregistering. This P2P network is designed to facilitate communication between peers using User Datagram Protocol (UDP) sockets. The foundation for developing this network was created using knowledge obtained from previous labs and lectures which are implemented in this project.
